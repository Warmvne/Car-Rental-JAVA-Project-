# Car-Rental-JAVA-Project-


Projet JAVA pour l'ECE



Goal:

The goal of the project is to enable the customers to rent a car for the desired
duration. The application will also support Car Rental Company to manage the
bookings made by the customers.




Program Description:

In this program you will write a set of supporting classes for a car renting
application. Here is an example of GUI.
The application should allow the customers to browse through all the available
cars of different types. For a desired duration, the customers will be able to book
the chosen car for renting.
The customer will be of two types: new customers or member customers. New
customers will be required to register and will be able to book without any
discounts offered. The member customers could be individual or business. The
member customers will have a login and will be able to book the car with discount
offered based on the type of the member.
You are expected to create a dummy screen to indicate the processing of
payments.




The application primarily involves details of the available car, their features and
per day prices as well as customer orders generated and maintained.
The application should be developed for two types of users:

1. Customers – Book the rental for the car, Bill calculation with/without
discounts, browsing the availability etc.

2. Employees – Update the currently available cars, introducing various
discount offers, maintain the customer records, review popularity of
cars etc.

You are expected to design and develop the database for this application along
with the Java classes necessary to implement the application.





Implementation requirements:

1. Necessary classes, methods and attributes should be designed using UML
diagram notation. All the classes, methods and attributes should be
explained in your documentation. Please discuss the design with me before
you start implementation.

2. You should be able to identify and introduce inheritance and aggregation
relationship wherever applicable.

3. Necessary GUI screens should be added for successful execution.

4. Records should be maintained in the database. Your Java code is expected
to read and write to multiple tables as required. OR you can create the
necessary text files.

5. Every table/text file must be populated with at least 6 records.

6. Above picture is an example of GUI. Your GUI does not have to look
exactly same.






Deadlines:

1. Design of the database and Java UML diagram: 27th Feb 2023

2. Weekly updates on the project will be taken from each team

3. The final project will not be accepted if the weekly updates are not
provided
